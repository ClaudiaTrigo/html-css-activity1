## 🌐 Project Overview
This project presents a three-page website developed as part of the **HTML and CSS** course at UOC.  
It explores the relationship between **nostalgia, digital culture, and Artificial Intelligence in music** through a structured and responsive design.

## 🧠 Structure
The website is divided into three main sections:

### 📰 `index.html` — *Article*
An adaptation of *“Un món sense nostàlgia”* by **José Heinz**, reflecting on nostalgia, algorithmic culture, and the idea of a perpetual present.

### 🎵 `recursos.html` — *Resources*
A curated list of **music-related AI tools** for composition, singing, production, and audio manipulation, including examples and links.

### 📚 `glossari.html` — *Glossary*
A detailed glossary defining all the Artificial Intelligence tools mentioned in the resources section, organized by category.

### 🎨 `style.css` — *Design*
Custom stylesheet applying responsive layouts, semantic structure, and a clean, minimalist visual identity.
